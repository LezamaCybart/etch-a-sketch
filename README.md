This project is part the The Odin Project curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project) 

live demo: https://lezamacybart.github.io/etch-a-sketch/

Functionality: \
    *It creates a default 16x16 grid. \
    *When the cursor hovers over a cell of the grid, the cell changes to a random color, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. \
    *Each pass of the cursor darkens the color of the cell by 10%, turning it black after 10 passes. \
    *The "clear and set size" button clears the grid, and prompts the user for a new grid size- \

Thoughts: \
    The project is a really good DOM manipulation using VanillaJS practice exercise. It ended up coming together a lot quicker than I thought it would, the hardest task was darkening the cells with each hover.
